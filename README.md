# Stuffy's Breeze Pack

A breeze pack that I created for DoL - mainly soundtracks from video games, requires the Breeze of Lewdity add-on.

Get Breeze here: [https://gitgud.io/velvetvillainess/breeze-of-lewdity]

## Installation

1. Go to releases and download stuffy.zip

2. Unzip and put the folder inside *game directory*\breeze\packs

3. Open the game, go to the Breeze of Lewdity tab and press "Import From File"

This also includes a text file for credits and muting encounters. More songs will be added in future releases.
