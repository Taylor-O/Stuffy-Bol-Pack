# Stuffy's Breeze Pack

A breeze pack that I created for DoL - mainly soundtracks from video games, requires the Breeze of Lewdity add-on. Adds 105 music tracks, can be used with other packs, though it might replace certain songs. More songs will be added in future releases for as long as I play the game. Includes four "secret tracks".
