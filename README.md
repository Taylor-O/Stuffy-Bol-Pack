# Stuffy's Breeze Pack

A breeze pack that I created for DoL - mainly soundtracks from video games, requires the Breeze of Lewdity add-on. Adds 77 music tracks, can be used with other packs, though it might replace certain songs.

Get Breeze here: [https://gitgud.io/velvetvillainess/breeze-of-lewdity]

## Installation

1. Go to releases and download stuffy.zip

2. Unzip and put the folder inside *game directory*\breeze\packs

3. Open the game, go to the Breeze of Lewdity tab and press "Import From File"

4. Upload the stuffy.json file

This also includes a text file for credits and muting encounters. More songs will be added in future releases for as long as I play the game. Includes two "secret tracks".
